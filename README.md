## What is rotur?

Rotur is a cloudlink based standard for packet based communications in turbowarp projects, Generally for Turbowarp-Based OSs.

## Sample Project

### This is essentially the prefered documentation on how to use Rotur, since it can be used to figure out the system yourself
[Download here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoturTW/main/main/Implementations/SCRATCH/Rotur_Example_Project.sb3)

# What can I use to make clients?

Rotur is able to be used on any one of the clients below, click the link to be taken to a page with code you can easily copy and paste to get your own client setup quickly!

## Information:

### Setup
This is for the initial setup of Rotur

[How to Get Connected](https://github.com/RoturTW/main/wiki/Connecting-to-Rotur)

### Packets
The way that packets are structured on Rotur uses cloudlink as a base and passes more information between clients about the connection and about the user thats connected as well as allowing more specific targeting of packets within the project using a "port" targeting system.

### The Client
Handling incoming packets and sending packets can be kinda tricky so we set out a guide for the formatting and the blocks you need to put together for the best and most reliable client

Its best to use the client from the example project at the top of this page
---
### Usernames
A rotur designation is the way that a username is formatted to tell other clients, what system is being used by that user
